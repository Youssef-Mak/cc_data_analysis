## Canada

'Within the remit of this law, the Government announced the introduction of the clean fuel standard regulatory framework to 
achieve 30 megatonnes of annual reductions in GHG emissions by 2030, contributing to Canadaâ€™s effort to achieve its overall
GHG mitigation target of 30% emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2030.

We can check to see if Canada did even meet its goals'
