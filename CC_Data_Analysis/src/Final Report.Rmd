# Introduction

Climate change is a growing problem in today's society. Many scientist have studied the affect of global warmiing on a global physical scale. However, the full relationships of greenhouse gas emissions on the world are not fully understood from a staticitcs point of view. Relationships such as 

-Identify a relationship between emissions and economy growth.

-Identify a relationship between emission and environement damages

-Identify protocol installment effect on government regulation activity

-Identify relationship between environmental tax revenue and emission

#Global Activity Growth Overview

The first techniques that used in order to determine the exact relationship between emissions and growth is using a time series.


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
