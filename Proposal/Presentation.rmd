# Problem at Hand

- Climate change and increasing greenhouse gas emissions are gaining public attention

- The polluant industries contribute to the economy

- Industries grow and contribute to economy but produce more emissions

- How do polluant industries contribute to economy growth

- How do regulations affect economical performance

- Analyze how polluant industries contribute to more emissions per sector

# Objectives

<!-- Maybe we could mention developing vs established economies for each of these points -->
- Measure the impact of pollutant industries on economic develoment

- Measure the effects of gas emission regulations on industry and economy growth

- Measure the effects(cost) of climate change on global economies (e.g. natural disasters)

# Data sets

- Climate change laws per country (LSE Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment)

- National income by activity (data.oecd)

- International greenhouse gas emissions (United Nations via Kaggle)

- Greenhouse gas emissions per country per subsector (CAIT Climate Data Explorer)

- National Footprint Accounts 2018 (Global Footprint Network)

# Methodology

- Find correlations between economic growth and emissions per country and sector

- ARIMA or other forecasting methods to forecast future growth and emissions

- Other shit

# Questions

# Thank you
